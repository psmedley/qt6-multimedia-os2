\title Qt Multimedia on macOS and iOS
\brief Platform notes for iOS

This page covers the availability of Qt Multimedia features on iOS and macOS.

\section1 Limitations

Since Qt Multimedia for iOS uses the camera and microphone, the \c Info.plist
assigned to QMAKE_INFO_PLIST in the project file must contain the keys
\c NSCameraUsageDescription and \c NSMicrophoneUsageDescription. Otherwise, the
application will abort on startup. See \l{Info.plist} documentation from Apple
for more information regarding this key.

\section1 Use of FFmpeg libraries on iOS

FFmpeg binaries from the online installer must be embedded into the application's
bundle. To embed these libraries, you can add the \l{qt6_add_ios_ffmpeg_libraries}{qt6_add_ios_ffmpeg_libraries()}
command to the app's CMakeLists.txt file:

\code
   qt_add_ios_ffmpeg_libraries(mytarget)
\endcode

\sa {qt6_add_ios_ffmpeg_libraries}{qt_add_ios_ffmpeg_libraries()}

\note FFmpeg binaries from the online installer are built for arm64 so that they can
pass validation with Apple Store Connect.
